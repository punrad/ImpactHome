INTEREST OF CONTENT
 
   Pretty solid intros, gave me more of an appreciation of the work knowing more about the people behind it. could have contained more   info other than how much coding they have done. V interesting content especially Prediction and analysis, all pages extremely relavent to the topic.
   
   ---Excellent---
  
  


CONSISTENCY AND QUALITY OF VISUAL PRESENTATION
    
   Landing page was mighty fine, could gave a larger overall heading but really nice layout and colour palette. Lovely minamalist look of the landing page didnt quite stay around for some of the content pages. Although 'Prediction & Analysis' and 'Past Medicine' had a nice newspaper layout. Nice pictures too.
   
   
   ---Outstanding---
  

QUALITY OF WRITTEN PRESENTATION

  A couple of grammatical errors and quite long paragraphs that could maybe be broken up a bit. There could be a bit of interactivity on the page scrolling and backgroup interest. Yeah a bit too much prose in general. But good writing ( I personally dont know how to write well anyway)
  
  
  ---Sound---



VALIDITY OF HTML

  Big brownie points for putting html tags to help the reader. Everything is nicely structured, readable and I didnt see much superfluous code apart from something about john smith which doesnt seem to be on the front end???
  
  ---very good---

  

EVIDENCE OF COLLABORATION

  Author info not written by author
    Author bio's were not written by the author. so thumbs up for that.
  Balanced contributions from members
     Seems like 'punrad' did a lot of the commits on the ImpactHome repo but that is because he is the admin. Yeah actually very 'punrad' heavy :( 
  Not completed at the last minute
     Unfortunately there was a commit at roughly 10 am showing a bit of last minute work but this was just a touch up.
     
   ---Acceptable---
