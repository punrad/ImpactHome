#Interest of Content
Good
#Consistency and quality of visual presentation
Acceptable, most individual pages look decent, but there's little consistency besides the nav-bar/burger menu 
(which does not work on the Modern Medicine page). Further, the Modern Medicine page does not seem to have any 
formatting. Prediction and Analysis does not scale with aspect ratio well.
#Quality of written presentation
Good, some pages stand out as having poor spelling and grammar, overall good quality of writting
#Validity of HTML
Very Good, HTML seems written well and neat. Meta tagged and titles are used consistently across pages.
#Evidence of collaboration
Weak. Although each person has done others' bios, the commits appear to show everything was done at last minute 
and also there is a clear imbalance between the quality of each page.
